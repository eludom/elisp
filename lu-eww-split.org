* Emacs and eww, open links in new window?

 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28458784/emacs-and-eww-open-links-in-new-window

I configured Emacs to open new links in eww like so:  

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (setq browse-url-browser-function 'eww-browse-url)  
#+END_EXAMPLE
     
Now when I click on a link, it opens in the same buffer.   
     
I would like it to open a new window (i.e split vertically like C -
x 3) and open the page in the newly created frame on the right. So
that I still have the original org-mode notes on the left.

[Edit]  
     
I hacked together something. But it only works when I activate the
hotkey, not when another function opens a link.
     
Ideally, I want something like the below, but for whenever I open a link (e.g in helm-google).
