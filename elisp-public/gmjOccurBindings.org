* Description
  This is a function to list current keybindings and do an occur match.

  Why? Usually when I list describe-bindings (C-h b) the next thing I
  do is switch to the buffer and search for the command I'm looking
  for.  appropos-command (C-h a) comes close, but I find the output
  too verbose.  Things get lost.

* Sample Output

  For C-u C-b "describe"

  #+begin_example
  48 matches for "describe" in buffer: *Help*
